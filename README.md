# Asteroids ðŸš€ðŸŒŒ

Just a clone of the "Asteroids" game that I'm challenging myself to make using
the Phaser game framework ðŸ˜ƒ Though, it still is currently a work-in-progress.

The below were some of the resources that I used in order to help me make this game:

* LLMs like ChatGPT!
* [Getting Started with Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started-phaser3)
* Assets from Kenny (thanks Kenny!)
  * [Simple Space](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/simple-space)
  * [Space Shooter Redux](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/space-shooter-redux)
  * [Sc-fi Sounds](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/sci-fi-sounds)
* [Phaser's Revenge](https://github.com/phaserjs/create-game/tree/main/scaffolding/demo/phasers-revenge)
  * I learned a lot about "scene management" over here
* [Asteroids Movement](https://github.com/phaserjs/examples/blob/master/public/src/physics/arcade/asteroids%20movement.js)
* [Bullet Pool](https://github.com/phaserjs/examples/blob/master/public/src/physics/matterjs/bullet%20pool.js)
